# Biglietto da visita in app

```txt
[A close-up shot of a hand holding a business card designed to look like a {file_format} file open in {code_editor}. The card shows code formatted in {syntax_type} with keys like {key1}, {key2}, {key3}, and {key4}. The window includes typical toolbar icons and a title bar labeled {file_name}, styled exactly like the interface of {code_editor}. Background is slightly blurred, keeping the focus on the card. Example placeholders: {file_format}: JSON, XML, YAML {code_editor}: Notepad++, VS Code {syntax_type}: JSON, XML {key1}: "name": "Your Name" {key2}: "title": "Your Title" {key3}: "email": "your@email.com" {key4}: "link": "yourwebsite" [{key5}: "phone": "Phone Number"] {file_name}: Business Card.json or Business Card.xml](<A close-up shot of a hand holding a business card designed to look like a {file_format} file open in {code_editor}.
